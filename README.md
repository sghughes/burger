# Eat-Da-Burger

This app allows the user to create and eat burgers of their choice. 

## Description
This app uses Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL. The user can type in the name of a burger to add it to the "not devoured" list on the left side of the screen. This also adds the burger to the MySQL database. To eat the burger, the user can click "EAT BURGER" under the burger they would like to eat. This moves the burger to the right side of the screen under the "devoured" list. The user can click "ADD BURGER BACK" if they would like to add the burger back to the "not devoured" list or they can type it in to the burger entry. 

## How to Use
